# Fall Detection Smart Bracelet Development  

## Motivation  
In today's aging society, the safety of elderly individuals has become a significant concern. Commercially available smartwatches are often expensive and include features that may not be useful for seniors. Therefore, I aim to create a fall detection smart bracelet specifically designed for the elderly. This bracelet will send notifications to family members when a fall is detected, allowing young people working away from home to stay informed about the safety of their elderly loved ones. This proactive approach can help prevent regrets caused by delayed responses.  

## Expected Benefits  
When a fall is detected, and the elderly person does not press the button within 10 seconds, the bracelet will automatically send a notification via Discord, requesting a callback to confirm their condition. This ensures timely assistance and helps determine whether an ambulance is needed.
